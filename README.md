# Go Hello World Example

This repository is part of a collection of "Hello, World!" examples implemented in various programming languages and assembly implementations for different architectures. Each repository in this collection demonstrates the minimal code required to output "Hello, World!" in its respective language or platform.

## Purpose

The primary goals of this repository are:

1. Demonstrate the minimal code required to write and run a Go program
2. Serve as a basic test for Go development environments
3. Provide a starting point for learning and experimentation

## Running the Example

To run this example, ensure you have Go installed on your system, then:

```bash
go run main.go
```

## Contributing

While this repository aims to maintain minimalism, bug fixes and improvements to documentation are welcome. Please ensure any changes maintain the simplicity of the example.
